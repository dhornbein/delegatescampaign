  text: Superdelegates are special voters that the Democratic National Committee gives special power to in determining the Democratic presidential primary. We are supporters of Democracy, participating in the Democratic primary, and concerned about superdelegates swinging the results of what real people actually voted for. No matter who you support, it’s time to make sure election results aren’t subverted.
