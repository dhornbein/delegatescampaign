explanation:
  text: <strong>Superdelegates</strong> are special voters that the Democratic National Committee gives special power to in determining the Democratic presidential primary. We are supporters of Democracy, participating in the Democratic primary, and concerned about superdelegates swinging the results of what real people actually voted for. No matter who you support, it’s time to make sure election results aren’t subverted.

  text: Hi - we’re <a href="http://readytofight.org/">Ready To Fight</a>. We started two years ago as Ready For Warren, a project to support Elizabeth Warren running for the Democratic presidential nomination, and changed our name to Ready To Fight once Bernie entered the race instead. But no matter who you’re supporting this election, you should be able to support the person with the most votes being the person who gets the nomination.
